/* JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that a variable can change its data type during runtime.
JavaScript, there are several data types that you can work with. */

/* 
Understanding JavaScript's data types is crucial as it forms the foundation of programming in JavaScript. There are eight fundamental data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, and object.

let userName = "Babulal Mandal"; // String
let yourAge = 27; // Number
let isUserLogedin = false; // boolean
let yourHealthScore = null; // null
let yourAddress; // undefined
let symbolOfCode = Symbol(); // symbol
let myIdentity = {name:"Babulal", age:27,};//object
let bigNumber = BigInt("154749494144449746944555"); //BigInt

/* 
Primitive Data Types:
String: Represents a sequence of characters, such as "Hello, world!".
Number: Represents numeric values, both integers and floating-point numbers.
Boolean: Represents true or false values.
Undefined: Indicates that a variable has been declared but hasnâ€™t been assigned a value yet.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any value.
Composite Data Types:
Object: A complex data type that can hold key-value pairs. Objects can be user-defined or built-in (e.g., arrays, dates, maps).
Array: An ordered collection of values, accessible by their index (e.g., ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]).
Function: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
Special Data Types:
Symbol: A unique and immutable value used as an identifier for object properties.
BigInt: Represents large integers beyond the range of regular numbers (e.g., 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n).
